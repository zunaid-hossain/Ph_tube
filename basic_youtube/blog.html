                    <span>var:</span>var was the primary way to declare variables in JavaScript. The scope of a var variable is either the function in which it is declared or the global scope if it's declared outside any function<br>
                    <span>let:</span> let was introduced to address some of the issues with var. The scope of a let variable is limited to the block in which it is declared which is typically denoted by a set of curly braces<br>
                    <span>const:</span> const stands for "constant." Variables declared with const are block-scoped, just like let, but they have an additional characteristic, their value cannot be reassigned once it has been assigned. In other words, const variables are immutable.

                    Undefined means a variable has been declared but has yet not been assigned a value.
                    Null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.

                    REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is a standard that guides the design and development of processes which enable us interact with data stored on a web servers.
                    <br>
                    API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API establishes a connection between programs so they can transfer data.
                    <br>
                    A REST API is a standardized way for web applications to communicate over the internet, where clients can access and manipulate resources (such as data or services) on a server using a set of predefined operations, often using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It promotes statelessness, scalability, and simplicity in web service design.
